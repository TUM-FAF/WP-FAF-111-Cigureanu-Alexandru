What is specific to my laboratory:
----------------------------------
It has both Nyan Cat and Nyan Cat Song.
In order to make sure that songs plays, you have to add winmm.dll(C:/windows/system32/) to libraries. In Code::Blocks : Project -> Build Option -> linker settings -> ADD
It can be add up to 20 bounce balls with different speed, angle of moving an color by left mouse button clickig.
Remark. I'm not sure if flickering problem is solved. I consulted petzold and you proposal links.
Conclusions
-----------
Funny Lab. I used to play around Nyan cat a bit. Finally I'm done with problem.
What I liked most is the fact how simple is timer using.
