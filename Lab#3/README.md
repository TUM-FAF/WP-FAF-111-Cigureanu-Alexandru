What is specific to my laboratory:
----------------------------------
Some of elements like(circles, triangles, lines,) are drawn on buttons. Onclick event on buttons they are changing it colors into reverso and became focused.

Conclusions
-----------
A interesting lab for me. I think that with some effort, it would became a mini paint app.

In this laboratory I studied basic drawing features of WinAPI, and mouse control. It gave me a considerable improve of my knowledge in windows programming.
