Conclusions
-----------
This laboratory work was an interesting one. I had the opportunity to buid an applications will a lot of basic drawing features, somewhat resembling the MS Paint application. 

The main difficulty I encountered was with limiting the allowed draing area, but I managed to solve this issue.

In this laboratory work I familiarized myself with all the drawing posibilities the Windows API gives us, and with the right way of working with the mouse, and letting the user control the application features using mouse clicks. 
This laboratory work layed an important base ground for future laboratory works, especialy in working with animations.
