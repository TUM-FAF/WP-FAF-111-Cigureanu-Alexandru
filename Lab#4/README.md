Title
-----
Windows Timer. Animation.

Contents
--------
- Windows timer

Mandatory Objectives (completed)
--------------------------------
- Create an animation based on Windows timer which involves at least 5 different drawn objects

Objectives With Points (completed)
----------------------------------
- Increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel **(2 pt)**
- Solve flicking problem **(2 pt)**
- Add animated objects which interact with each other (2-6 pt), ex.:
  - Few balls which have different velocity and moving angles, and colors. 
  - add balls with mouse, 
- Animate a Nyan Cat that leaves a rainbow tail (Math.floor(+30% for task with interacting objects))

What is specific to my laboratory:
----------------------------------
It has both Nyan Cat and Nyan Cat Song.
In order to make sure that songs plays, you have to add winmm.dll(C:/windows/system32/) to libraries. In Code::Blocks : Project -> Build Option -> linker settings -> ADD
It can be add up to 20 bounce balls with different speed, angle of moving an color by left mouse button clickig.
Remark. I'm not sure if flickering problem is solved. I consulted petzold and you proposal links.
Conclusions
-----------
Funny Lab. I used to play around Nyan cat a bit. Finally I'm done with problem.
What I liked most is the fact how simple is timer using.
